### The Goal
After mastering "Hello World," I wanted to tackle real-time data. This app allows users to create accounts and message each other instantly.

### Technical Challenge
The biggest hurdle was ensuring that only authenticated users could access specific chat rooms. I implemented this using **JWT Auth** and protected routes.
